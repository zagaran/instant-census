2 Hour buffer between send times

Informational Messages:
    Do not get resent
    Fall outsit normal resend structure
    Sent before questions if at same time
    Ignored for determining last question

Resending Behavior:
    If a resend runs into another iteration of its schedule, it is not resent
    Ignore Informational Messages
    Resend times are tied to Schedule send time NOT respond time
    Resends are configured with a time to send, and a number of resends; the next time that time comes up, it is resent and every subsequent time it is that time until you have hit the specified number of resends
    Resends are set for every Schedule, they must be set for every schedule, you can set it to NEVER resend

Conflict Logic:
    If it is a conflict between two iterations of the same schedule, use the second one, no conflict
    Informational Messages do not trigger a conflict; just send them (ideally BEFORE the question)
    In event of conflict, ask it all; prioritize one survey, ask that first, upon its completion ask the second, independent resend conditions apply?
    Follow-ups first, resends, new questions

3 Schedule Types:
    1. Recurring: every [DAYOFWEEK] at [TIME]
    2. Specific Dates: On [DATE] at [TIME]
    3. Question Bag: Every [X DAYS] at [TIME] limit [QUESTIONLIMIT]
