# Instant Census Documentation

_Last updated: Monday, March 21, 2016_

---

Welcome to Instant Census! This documentation should help you get the most out of
your Instant Census deployment.<This documentation is meant to be detailed and
technical in nature; for common questions in a quick & easy format, please see our
FAQ page.>

{% endfilter %}
{% filter markdown %}

## Table of Contents
[TOC]

## 1.0.0 Navigation

In order to help you Navigate Instant Census, a **Navigation Bar** exists at the
top of every page of the Website. This Bar will follow you as you scroll up or down,
allowing you to conveniently access the entire site.

* Clicking the Instant Census logo will take you to the **Cohorts** Page. From there
  you will be able to manage, create, and delete Cohorts.
* If you have already navigated to within a particular **Cohort**, clicking the
  **Recipient Management** tab will take you to the page where you can add and edit Recipients.
* Similarly, if you are already within a **Cohort**, clicking the **Survey Builder**
  tab will take you to the page where you can build, edit, and manage **Schedules**.
* The **Inbox** tab will take you to a page displaying all of the Recipients who 
  have sent in messages your deployment has been customized to flag, allowing you
  to take any further action that might be necessary. For details on which messages
  your deployment is flagging as "Needs Review", please contact [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com). 
* The **Cohorts** tab will take you back to the Cohorts Page, just like clicking
  the Instant Census logo.
* The **Docs** tab will take you back here.
* To the right of the Docs tab is the **Logout** Button; clicking this will log 
  you out of the system.
  
Directly beneath the Navigation Bar is another bar. If you are within
a particular Cohort, the Cohort's **Name** will be displayed there. Furthermore,
certain pages will have a Dropdown menu of **Actions** in the left-hand side of
that bar. If a page has any such Actions, they will be more fully described in the
documentation for that page. If neither of the above is true, the bar will show 
you the name under which you are logged in.

## 2.0.0 Cohorts
 
After logging into Instant Census, you will be taken to the Cohorts page. This page
allows you to create and manage your **Cohorts**, and navigate to the various other 
features of Instant Census. In order to return to this page, you may either click
the Cohorts tab in the **Navigation Bar**, or click the Instant Census logo on that
same Bar.

### 2.1.0 What is a Cohort?

Cohorts are the highest level of organization for Instant Census. Each Cohort has
a group of **Recipients** and **Schedules** attached to it. Each Recipient in a Cohort will
only receive Schedules from that Cohort, and each Schedule on a Cohort will only
be sent to Recipients on that same Cohort. Basically, Cohorts allow you to group together
people to whom you want to send the same content. In addition, each Cohort has
certain settings which affect everyone on that Cohort.

Each Cohort is displayed separately on the Cohorts page, along with useful information
about that Cohort. In particular, it shows you the number of Recipients currently associated
with that Cohort, the number of Messages sent in by Recipients that Instant Census couldn't
process correctly, the total number of SMS Messages, both sent out and received,
associated with that Cohort, the Phone Numbers from which Recipients on the Cohort
will receive Messages, and the date and time on which the Cohort was created.

Additionally, it displays a number of configurable options for that Cohort: 

* Each Cohort has a unique, but editable, **Name** by which it can be identified. 
* The **Desired Area Code** indicates the area code from which you would like your
  messages to be sent. That is, Instant Census will attempt to communicate with
  Recipients using a Phone Number with the area code indicated. You do not have to specify
  a Desired Area Code if you do not wish to do so.
* The **Inactive Limit** indicates the number of **Questions** in a row a Recipient must
  ignore in order to automatically be set to **Inactive**.
* The **Welcome Message** is sent to every Recipient on a Cohort when they are first
  added to that Cohort. If either the Cohort or the Recipient is not **Active** at that
  time, this message is sent as soon as they become eligible to receive messages.
  Note that only the first part of the Welcome Message is editable; the second part,
  indicating how a Recipient may opt-out of receiving communications, *must* be sent to
  every Recipient when they become Active.
  
The Buttons on the right of each Cohort let you further interact with that Cohort:

* Clicking **Manage Recipients** or **Survey Builder** will take you to pages that let
  you interact with the Recipients and Schedules on that particular Cohort.
* The **Edit Cohort** Button will launch a pop-up allowing you to edit the configurable
  options of the Cohort.
* The **Download Data** Button allows you to Download the Data associated with that
  Cohort.
* The **Mark Cohort as Completed** button will allow you to end all activities on a Cohort.
  The Cohort will be set to the **Completed** Status, and no new Messages will be
  sent from the Cohort. The Cohort will also no longer be able to receive new Messages.
  You will be unable to make any changes to the Cohort, but all of its data will
  still be available for perusal. This means that the Cohort will no longer cost
  any money. This action cannot be undone.
* Finally, to the left of the Mark Cohort as Completed Button and beneath the Survey Builder 
  Button, is the **Cohort Status** Button. This Button indicates the current **Status**
  of the Cohort. A Cohort may be **Pending**, **Paused**, **Active** or Completed, and by default they start
  Pending. A Paused or Pending Cohort may have Recipients and Schedules attached to it, but will not
  send anything to its Recipients. A Pending Cohort has no outgoing numbers, and
  cannot communicate with Recipients. Thus, like a Completed Cohort you will not be
  charged for Pending Cohorts. A Paused Cohort, by contrast, does have outgoing phone
  numbers. Recipients may text in to a Paused Cohort, and their Messages will be 
  stored and made available for your viewing and use. You will be charged for all
  Active Cohorts will send and receive Messages normally. You will be charged for
  all Active and Paused Cohorts. Clicking the Cohort Status Button will change a 
  Pending Cohort to Active, a Paused Cohort to Active, or an Active Cohort to Paused. 
  Additionally a Message will be sent to all Recipients on that Cohort informing 
  them of the Cohort's change in Status.  
  
Finally, in the top right of the Cohort, to the right of the Cohort's Name, is the
**Delete Cohort** Button. Clicking this will allow you to completely and irrevocably
eliminate a Cohort. It behaves similarly to marking the Cohort as Completed, only
the Cohort will no longer even be displayed, and any data on the Cohort will no
longer be accessible. If you click this, it will launch a confirmation Popup. If
you decide against deleting the Cohort, click the **X** in the top right or the **Cancel**
Button in the bottom right to dismiss the Popup and not delete the Cohort. If you
would still like to delete the Cohort, click the **Yes** Button in the bottom right
of the Cohort. You cannot undo this action once you have taken it.

### 2.2.0 Adding Cohorts

To add a new **Cohort**, hover your mouse over the **Actions** Dropdown just below the
Instant Census logo in the **Navigation Bar**, then click the **Add Cohort** Button
that appears. This will launch a Popup which you can use to configure the options
for your new Cohort. If you decide against creating a new Cohort, you may click
the **X** at the top right of the popup, the **Cancel** Button on the bottom right, or
anywhere not within the Popup. This will dismiss the Popup without creating a new
Cohort.

* The **Name** of the new Cohort should be entered in the Cohort Name field at the 
  top of the Popup. This Name may contain letters, numbers, and spaces, but it may 
  not be more than 100 characters, and may not be the same as the name of any Cohort 
  that already exists.
* The **Welcome Message** field allows you to configure the Welcome Message for the
  new Cohort. This Welcome Message will be sent to every **Recipient** on the Cohort, either
  upon their creation *or* upon them first becoming eligible to receive Messages. While
  the first part of the Welcome Message may be changed to anything you want, the second
  part *must* be sent to every Recipient as is. This section is displayed exclusively for your
  reference, and may not be changed or altered.
* The **Inactive Limit** sets the number of **Questions** a Recipient must ignore in
  a row before they are automatically set to **Inactive**. **Messages** and other communications
  that do not expect a response do not count toward this total, and as soon as a
  Recipient responds the count towards the Limit is set back to zero. Likewise, if the
  Recipient is reactivated, either by you or them, then the count toward this Limit
  is reset.
* The **Desired Area Code** field lets you set the area code from which you would
  like Recipients to receive Messages. This field is completely optional. If a valid
  United States area code is entered, then Instant Census will attempt to make sure
  Recipients receive communications from Phone Numbers with that area code, or a geographically
  nearby area code.
  
When you have configured these options as you desire, clicking the **Okay** Button
at the bottom right of the Popup will create a Cohort with those attributes. If
you want to change any of these configurations later, you may do so by pressing
the **Edit Cohort** Button for that Cohort. Every Cohort is automatically created
with the **Pending** Status. To change this, click the **Cohort Status** Button on
the bottom left of the Cohort's Button Panel.

By default, Cohorts are created so that only Recipients you as administrator add
are allowed to join the Cohort. Individuals outside the Recipient pool who attempt
to message one of your Cohorts' Phone Numbers are brought to your attention, but
not on-boarded as Recipients. If you would like individuals outside the current
Recipient pool to be able to add themselves to your Cohorts, contact [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).

### 2.3.0 Editing Cohorts

In order to edit any of the configurable attributes of a **Cohort**, click the 
**Edit Cohort** button in the top right of the Cohort you wish to edit. This will 
launch a Popup using which you can configure the options for the Cohort. This Popup
will already be populated with the current attributes for the Cohort. If you decide 
against editing the Cohort, you may click the **X** at the top right of the popup, the 
**Cancel** Button on the bottom right, or anywhere not within the Popup. This will 
dismiss the Popup without saving any of the changes you have made to the Cohort.

* The Cohort Name field allows you to change the **Name** of the Cohort. You may
  change a Cohort's name to any combination of alphanumeric characters. However,
  this name may not be more than 100 characters long, and cannot be the same as
  the Name of any existing Cohort.  
* The **Welcome Message** field allows you to edit the Cohort's Welcome Message.
  This Welcome Message is sent to **Recipients** the first time they become eligible
  to receive Messages from the system. While the first part of the Welcome Message 
  can be edited freely, the second part *must* be sent to each and every 
  Recipient. This section is displayed exclusively for your reference, and may not be 
  changed or altered. Recipients already active on the system when you change this Message
  will not receive the new Welcome Message; this will only be sent to Recipients who
  are subsequently added to the system. 
* The **Inactive Limit** sets the number of **Questions** a Recipient must ignore in
  a row before they are automatically set to **Inactive**. Messages and other communications
  that do not expect a response do not count toward this total, and as soon as a
  Recipient responds the count towards the Limit is set back to zero. Likewise, if the
  Recipient is reactivated, either by you or them, then the count toward this Limit
  is reset. Increasing the Inactive Limit will not automatically reactivate any
  Recipients already set to **Inactive**; you must reactivate such Recipients manually
  if you wish to resume contact with them.
* The Desired Area Code field lets you set the area code from which you would
  like Recipients to receive Messages. This field is completely optional. If a valid
  United States area code is entered, then Instant Census will attempt to make sure
  Recipients receive communications from Phone Numbers with that area code, or a geographically
  nearby area code. However, changing this value will not change the Phone Number 
  from which existing Recipients receive Messages. It will only apply to Recipients created
  after the change, and some of them may receive Messages from Phone Numbers already
  in use by the system. 
  
When you have configured these options as you desire, clicking the **Okay** Button
at the bottom right of the Popup will save the changes to the Cohort. You may Edit
a Cohort's attributes any number of times. Note that clicking the Edit Button does
not allow you to change a Cohort's **Status**. To do this, click the **Cohort Status**
Button on the bottom left of the Cohort's Button Panel.

### 2.4.0 Cohort Status

A Cohort's **Status** indicates whether or not a Cohort is actively sending out
**Schedules**. Every Cohort has a Status, which may be **Pending**, **Paused**, 
**Active**, or **Completed**, and every Cohort is created Paused.

* A Pending Cohort will not send out **Schedules**. It has no Phone Numbers with
  which to send out messages, and consequently no Phone Numbers to which **Recipients**
  may send information. The Pending Status allows you to prepare Cohorts for actual
  use. 
* A Paused Cohort will not send out Schedules. Recipients may still text in to the
  system, and their communications will be recorded by the system, but Recipients on
  a Paused Cohort will send Recipients no new proactive communications from the system.
* An Active Cohort will send out Schedules to all **Active** Recipients on that Cohort.
  Thus, in order to actually communicate with your Recipients, they must be on Active
  Cohorts.
* A Completed Cohort is finished and can longer take any actions. While all of its
  data is available for perusal, it can no longer send Messages, can no longer receive
  Messages, and can never be used again.
  
Cohorts are created Pending, in order to prevent incomplete Schedules from being
sent out to an incomplete Recipient base. Once you are satisfied that a Cohort is ready
for use, you may simply change the Cohort from Pending to Active to begin sending
Messages. Likewise, if at any time you feel that a Cohort should be temporarily
suspended, Pausing it will prevent further Messages from being sent.

The Status of a Cohort is displayed on the **Cohort Status** Button. This Button is
located on the bottom left of the Cohort's Button Panel, directly beneath the **Survey
Builder** Button and to the left of the **Mark Cohort as Completed** Button. If this Button
says 'Cohort Active', then the Cohort is active; if it says 'Cohort Paused' then
the Cohort  is paused. This Button also changes color depending on the Status of
the Cohort. Green indicates Active, Grey Pending, Yellow Paused, and faded Green Completed.

This same Cohort Status Button can be used to change the Status of a Cohort. When
clicked, this button will change the Status of the Cohort from Pending to Active,
Paused to Active, or Active to Paused. You may change the Status of a Cohort as many times as you like,
as often as you like. However, whenever a Cohort is changed to Active, all
Recipients on the Cohort will be sent a Message informing them of the activation. Similarly,
when a Cohort is changed from Active to Paused, all Recipients on the Cohort will be
sent a Message informing them that they have been paused. The only exceptions
are that Recipients added to a Paused Cohort will receive the **Welcome Message** upon
the Cohort's reactivation, and Recipients who are themselves **Paused**, **Inactive**, 
or **Disabled** will not receive these Messages. 

In order to set a Cohort to Completed, you must click the Mark Cohort as Completed
Button. This will launch a Popup describing the ramifications of setting the Cohort's
Status to Completed, and prompt you to confirm your decision. If you decide against
setting the Cohort to Completed (which is an irrevocable, unchangeable decision),
click the **X** at the top right or the **Cancel** Button at the bottom right of the
Popup. To actually set the Cohort to Completed, click the **Yes, Mark Cohort as
Completed** Button in the bottom right of the Popup.

### 2.5.0 Other Information

If there are any important limitations governing your use of Instant Census, they
will be displayed and monitored here. For full details about these limitations,
please get in touch with [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).

## 3.0.0 Recipient Management

The Recipient Management Page allows you to view information about, and change the **Attributes**
of, Recipients. Each **Cohort** has its own Recipient Management Page. To access this page,
click the **Manage Recipients** Button on the top left of the Cohort's Button Panel on
the Cohort's Page. If you are already within a particular Cohort, you can instead
click the Recipient Management tab in the **Navigation Bar**.

### 3.1.0 What is a Recipient?

Recipients are the end Recipients of your **Schedules**, the people who will receive and respond
to your surveys. Every Recipient belongs to a particular **Cohort**, which controls the
Schedules they receive and certain other areas of their experience. Each Recipient is 
primarily identified by their Phone Number, which is of course the essential piece 
of information needed about a person to be able to send them an SMS survey. On the Recipient 
Management Page, each of these Recipients is presented as an entry on a table to effectively 
organize all the Recipients you may have.

### 3.2.0 Reading Recipient Entries

The Recipient Table is the primary method of managing and maintaining Recipients on a particular
Cohort. The first three columns in the Recipient Table always contain the same information. 

* The first column, which is unlabeled, has a Button for each Recipient which takes you to that Recipient's 
  **Message Sender**. That page contains more information about that Recipient, including 
  a complete history of Messages sent between Instant Census and the Recipient, as well 
  as functionality to send Messages to that Recipient manually.
* The first column also has a delete Button (to the right of the Message Sender Button)
  which allows you to delete a Recipient. Clicking this will launch a Popup using 
  confirming that you wish to delete the Recipient. If you decide against deleting
  the Recipient, you may click the **X** at the top right of the popup, the **Cancel** 
  Button on the bottom right, or anywhere not within the Popup. This will dismiss 
  the Popup without deleting the Recipient. If you really wish to delete the Recipient,
  removing them from the Cohort and preventing Instant Census from sending them additional
  communications, click the red **Delete User** Button in the bottom right of the Popup.
* The second column, labeled Phone Number, displays a Recipient's Phone Number. This 
  number is always formatted displaying country code, and without spaces, dashes,
  or any other delimiter.
* The third column, labeled Status, displays the Recipient's **Status**. This Status
  indicates whether a Recipient is actively receiving Messages, and clicking it allows
  you to change the Status of a Recipient.
* The fourth column, labeled Timezone, indicates the Timezone to which the Recipient
  is assigned. Whenever a Schedule is sent to a Recipient, it will be sent at the indicated
  time in the appropriate Timezone for that Recipient. Clicking it launches a popup allowing
  you to change the Timezone for this Recipient. By default, this attribute is set to
  US Eastern Standard Time.
  
Any additional columns display **Recipient Attributes**, a key component to the interaction
between Recipients and Surveys. Recipient Attributes are created by you, may be set to any
alphanumeric value, and will appear in alphabetical order to the right of the Status
column. Any of these Attributes, as well as the Recipient's Phone Number, may be
freely edited at any time. Simply click on the text in the appropriate cell of the
table to begin editing the information. Once you are done, hit enter or click anywhere
outside the cell. Once you see the small, green **Saved** message in the lower left
of your screen, the changes have been saved. If there were any problems saving your
changes, a small red **Error** message will appear in the same position.

In order to facilitate accessing the information on the Recipient table, there are search
and sorting functions for the table. 

* Any text entered in the Search bar above the right hand side of the Recipient Table 
  will hide any entries on the table that do not contain the entered text. This 
  can include numbers, and every column is checked for matching text. 
* Each column in the table can be sorted. Clicking the Up/Down arrow icons on the
  right side of each column in the header will sort the table by the contents of
  that column. The columns are sorted either numerically or alphabetically, depending
  on the contents of the cells in the column, and clicking the arrow again will 
  alternate between ascending and descending sorting.
  
### 3.3.0 Adding Recipients

By default, there are no Recipients attached to any particular Cohort. There are two
methods for entering Recipients. To access either, you must hover over the **Actions**
Dropdown directly below the Instant Census logo in the **Navigation Bar**. This
will display a menu of options.

* To add a single Recipient, click the **Add Recipient** Button. This will launch a Popup
  prompting you to enter the new Recipient's Phone Number. Clicking the **X** in the top
  right of the Popup or the **Cancel** Button in the bottom right will dismiss the
  Popup without creating a new Recipient. Once you have entered the Phone Number, clicking
  **Add Recipient** in the bottom Right will create a Recipient with that Phone Number.
* To add multiple Recipients, click the **Upload Recipient Spreadsheet** Button. This will
  allow you to upload a spreadsheet containing multiple Recipients from your computer.
  Clicking cancel or X on the Popup displayed will dismiss it without creating new
  Recipients. Once you have selected the spreadsheet you want to upload, clicking 'Open'
  will begin the upload.
  
Because Recipients are identified by Phone Number, no two Recipients may have the same Phone
Number. If you attempt to create a new Recipient with the same Phone Number as an existing
Recipient, or if you attempt to create multiple new Recipients with the same Phone Numbers,
you will encounter an error and the Recipient will not be created. At this time, only
US Phone Numbers are supported by Instant Census. You must include the area code
of the Phone Number when you create it.

Spreadsheets may be uploaded in two modes: **Safe** and **Unrestricted**. In Safe
Upload, the spreadsheet cannot overwrite the information of existing Recipients.
I.e., if a Recipient is already on the Cohort, and their Phone Number appears in
the spreadsheet you are uploading, then that row of the spreadsheet will be ignored
and no changes will be made to the existing Recipient.

In Unrestricted Upload, Recipients already on the Cohort may have their information
edited based on the information appearing in the spreadsheet. While this can allow
you to update information on Recipients en masse, it can be dangerous. In particular,
empty cells in an uploaded spreadsheet will reset Attributes to their **Default Value**; 
as a result, any Attributes you do not wish to alter must
have their current, correct value filled out in any spreadsheet being uploaded Unrestricted.

When uploading multiple Recipients as a spreadsheet, there are a few other important
things to keep in mind.

* You may only upload .csv, .xls, and .xlsx files. These are the only filetypes
  supported by Instant Census for Recipient upload. Any other file types will result
  in an error.
  
<table style="width:50%; float:right; margin-left: 15px; margin-bottom: 10px;" border="1">
    <caption style="text-align:center;">Example Format for a Recipient Upload Spreadsheet</caption>
    <tr>
        <th>Phone Number</th>
        <th>Attribute 1</th>
        <th>Attribute 2</th>
        <th>Attribute 3</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>555-555-5555</td>
        <td>6</td>
        <td></td>
        <td>tuna</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>555-555-5556</td>
        <td>8</td>
        <td>no</td>

    </tr>
</table>

* The first row in the file must be a header, and the first item must be a 'Phone
  Number' column. This may by one or two words, and capitalization does not matter,
  but this must be the first column heading or the upload will not work.
* As a corollary of the above, the Phone Number of each Recipient must be in the first
  column. The content of the first column will be interpreted as the Recipient's Phone
  Number.
* If you wish to include timezone designations in your spreadsheet, the column must
  be titled "timezone". Any variation on this will not work correctly.
* You may, optionally, include additional **Recipient Attributes** in the spreadsheet.
  You may include some or all of the existing Recipient Attributes, and they need not
  be in order, but you can only include existing Custom Attributes. If you include
  any Recipient Attribute Columns, their contents will be taken as the Recipient Attribute
  value for that Recipient. Any cells left blank in such a column will be set to the
  Default Value of that Attribute.
* Depending on the speed of your internet connection and the size of the Recipient spreadsheet 
  you are trying to upload, it could take some time to complete the uploading process.

### 3.4.0 Editing Recipients

Editing an existing Recipient is largely a matter of editing the appropriate cell in
the Recipient Table.  

In order to change a Recipient's Status, simply click on the cell in the Status column.
If the Recipient is **Active** this will change them to **Paused**. If the Recipient is Paused
this will set them to Active. **Pending**, **Disabled**, and **Inactive** Recipients cannot be changed 
by you. In order to set a Recipient to Disabled, that Recipient must text in 'Stop', and Recipients
only become Inactive when they fail to respond to a certain number of **Questions**
in a row. In order to reactivate a Disabled or Inactive Recipient that Recipient must
send a message to Instant Census. Recipients by default start Pending, and must text
in confirming their desire to join the **Cohort** to be set to Active. By default
Recipients cannot by default add themselves to your deployment. To access this
functionality, please contact [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).

In order to change a Recipient's Timezone, click on the cell in the Timezone column. This
will launch a Popup, allowing you to select a new Timezone for that Recipient. Clicking
on the Dropdown in the middle of the Popup will allow you to select a new Timezone.
Once you have selected the Timezone you want, click **Change Recipient Timezone** to make
the change. If you decide against altering a Recipient's timezone, simply click the **X**
in the top right, or the **Cancel** Button in the bottom right. Bear in mind that
changing a Recipient's Timezone when they are Active and part of an Active cohort may
have unexpected and undesirable effects on system behavior. Though you can set a
Recipient to any Timezone, Instant Census is only designed and authorized for use within
the United States of America.

If you click on any other cell, except the first, you will be able to freely edit
it's text value. Once you have made the edit, clicking away from the cell in any 
way will save the changes you have made. A small, green **Saved** message will appear
in the lower left corner of the page to confirm your change has been saved. If you
instead see a red **Error** message, something has gone wrong and your change has
not been saved.

When editing a Recipient's Phone Number, remember that no two Recipients can have the same
Phone Number. If you attempt to change a Recipient's Phone Number to another Number
already in use, an error will occur and the change will not be made.

Furthermore, **Recipient Attributes** may not have blank values. If you attempt to change
a Recipient Attribute to be blank, it will automatically be filled with the **Default
Value** for that Attribute. If you would like to indicate that a Recipient does not have
a certain Attribute, use "None", "N/A", or something similar instead.

Due to the nature of the system, if you make multiple changes to a particular field
in succession without waiting for confirmation that the change has saved, there
is no guarantee that the last change you made will be the change applied. Therefore,
be careful when making multiple rapid edits to a particular field. If a change has
been saved successfully, a small green "Success" box will appear in the bottom left
of the page. This indicates that any future changes you make will be applied *after*
that change.

### 3.5.0 Status

In addition to having a mandatory Phone Number, each Recipient has a **Status**. This 
Status indicates whether or not a Recipient is actively receiving Messages from Instant 
Census, and is shown in the third column of the Recipients table. There are four possible 
Recipient statuses.

* **Pending** is the default Recipient Status for Recipients who text in to a **Cohort**.
  When a Recipient messages in to a Cohort they are not already on, they will created
  in the system as Pending, and sent a message asking them to confirm their desire
  to use the system. When they confirm that they wish to join the Cohort, their Status
  is automatically set to **Active**. By default Recipients cannot add themselves
  to Cohorts. If you wish Recipients to be able to text-in to your Cohorts, contact
  [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).
* Active is the default Status for Recipients you add to the system. An Active 
  Recipient is receiving Messages from Instant Census normally.
* **Paused** indicates that the Recipient is no longer receiving Messages from Instant
  Census. Recipients are set to Paused manually by you on this page. Recipients cannot reactivate
  themselves via text message and can only be reactivated by an administrator.
* **Inactive** is much like Paused in that it indicates a Recipient is no longer receiving
  Messages from Instant Census. Unlike Paused, a Recipient becomes Inactive when they fail
  to respond to a number of Questions in a row equal to the Cohort's **Inactive 
  Limit** and can reactivate themselves by texting back in.
* **Disabled** is much like Paused in that it indicates a Recipient is no longer receiving
  Messages from Instant Census. Unlike Paused, Recipients make themselves Disabled by
  texting Instant Census the message "Stop".
  
You may change a Recipient's Status by clicking their current Status in the third column
of the table. If a Recipient is Active, this will change them to Paused, and if they
are Paused, it will set them to Active. Note that you cannot change the Status of 
a Pending, Disabled, or Inactive Recipient, nor can you set a Recipient to Pending, Disabled, or Inactive. Recipients 
*must* disable themselves by texting "Stop", and Recipients may only become Inactive
by failing to respond to a number of Questions in a row equal to the Inactive Limit.
Once a Recipient is Disabled or Inactive, you cannot reactivate them. They must reactivate themselves 
by texting in to the system, which will change their Status from either Disabled or Inactive
to Active. A Paused Recipient cannot reactivate them by texting back in. Pending
Recipients are set to Active as soon as they confirm that they wish to participate. Beyond this, 
you may change a Recipient's Status as many times and as frequently as you desire. However, 
when a Recipient's Status is changed, the Recipient is sent a Message informing them of that 
Status change.

### 3.6.0 Recipient Attributes & Recipients

**Recipient Attributes** are the primary way by which Surveys can be tailored to a particular
**Recipient**. Every Recipient in a particular **Cohort** has the same set of Recipient Attributes,
but each Recipient may have different value for that Attribute. Furthermore, each Recipient
Attribute has a **Default Value** set at time of creation which serves as the Attribute
value for any Recipient on the Cohort who has not had the Attribute explicitly set. These
values can then be checked, and set, by Surveys to guide the course of communication.

In order to create a Recipient Attribute from the **Recipient Management** Page, hover over
the Dropdown labeled **Actions**, directly below the Instant Census logo in the
**Navigation Bar**. Then, in the menu that appears, click on the **Add Recipient Attribute**
Button. This will launch a Popup using which you can create the Recipient Attribute.
If you decide against creating a new Recipient Attribute, simply click the **X** in the top
right of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button in the bottom left.

* In the Name field put the Name of the Attribute. This is the label under which the
  Attribute will be listed in the Recipient Table. Each Recipient Attribute must have a unique
  name, so make sure this value is not shared by any existing Attributes.
* In the Default Value field, put the value you want the attribute to have by default.
  Any Recipients already in the system when you create this Recipient Attribute will automatically
  have the Default Value as their value for this Attribute. Any Recipients created subsequently
  will automatically have this assigned as their value for this Attribute. You must
  give a Default Value for each Attribute.
  
Once you are satisfied with the Name and Default Value of the Recipient Attribute, clicking
**Add Recipient Attribute** at the bottom right of the Popup will create an attribute
with that name, and assign the Default Value to all existing Recipients. If you wish
to change the Default Value for an attribute, click the pencil next to the Attribute's
name. This which launch a popup allowing you to edit the Default Value for that Attribute.

If you want to change a particular Recipient's Attribute, you may do so from the Recipient
Management Page by clicking the cell with the value in it. This will allow you to 
edit that value. As soon as you click away from the cell, the value of the Attribute
for that Recipient will be changed to whatever you have entered. If you try to change
a Recipient's attribute to have no value, it will automatically be replaced with the
Attribute's Default Value.

You may also create/edit Attributes by uploading a spreadsheet of Recipients. If
you include an Attribute that does not yet exist in your spreadsheet, an Attribute
with the name will be created. An Attribute created in this way has a Default Value
of **N/A**. Recipients created from this upload will start with their Attribute set
to whatever value you give them. Blank Attributes for a particular Recipient will
be set to the Attribute's Default Value. If you upload a spreadsheet in **Unrestricted**
mode, you can also effect the Attributes of existing Recipients in this way. Such existing
Recipients will still have Attributes for which they have a blank cell set to the
Default Value, so if you wish to leave an Attribute of an existing Recipient unchanged
you must still enter the correct information into the spreadsheet.

### 3.7.0 Download Data

In addition to the above features, it is possible to download data from
the **Recipient Management** page. To do so, hover over the **Actions** Dropdown on the
top left of the page, directly below the Instant Census logo in the **Navigation
Bar**. In the menu that appears, click on **Download Recipients Data**. This will start
the Download of Recipient data.

### 3.8.0 Timezone Names

These are the currently supported timezone names as set by the IANA
([Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](http://www.iana.org/)) that are available for
configuring recipient timezones:
{% for timezone in TIMEZONE_LIST %}
* {{ timezone }}
{% endfor %}

## 4.0.0 Message Sender

The **Message Sender** Page provides a platform to interact directly with individual **Recipients**.
To access a Recipient's Message Sender, click on the Button for that Recipient in the SMS
column of the Recipient Table. This will take you directly to that Recipient's Message Sender.

### 4.1.0 Main Attributes

The **Main Attributes** Box contains some of the primary information about that
Recipient.

* **Recipient Phone** indicates the Phone Number of that Recipient.
* The **Cohort** indicated is the Cohort to which the Recipient belongs.
* The Cohort Status indicates whether the Cohort to which the Recipeint belongs
  is **Active**, **Paused**, **Pending**, or **Completed**. This, along with the
  Recipeint's Status, lets you know whether or not this person is actively receiving
  communications from Instant Census.
* **System Number** indicates the Phone Number from which Instant Census messages
  the Recipient. Multiple Recipients may have the same System Number. This number is assigned
  at Recipient creation and cannot be changed.
* **Timezone** indicates the Timezone to which the Recipient is set. This determines
  their local time, and thus controls when they receive **Schedules** set for a 
  particular hour.
* **Currently in active survey?** indicates whether or not the Recipient is in the middle
  of responding to a Survey. If this item is "yes", the Recipient is currently receiving
  and responding to **Questions** sent out by Instant Census. If this item is "no",
  the Recipient is not in the process of responding to a Survey.
* **Unhandled Messages** indicates whether or not the Recipient has sent in Messages
  your deployment has flagged as **Needs Review**. For more information on what
  Messages your deployment is flagging, contact [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).
  You can check a Recipient's Unhandled Messages both in the **Message History** Box
  on the right, and the **Inbox** Page accessible from the **Navigation Bar**.
  
Note that you may edit the Recipient Phone Number from here. Simply click the Recipient's
current phone number and begin editing. Once you have made the edit, clicking away from the number in any 
way will save the changes you have made. A small, green **Saved** message will appear
in the lower left corner of the page to confirm your change has been saved. If you
instead see a red **Error** message, something has gone wrong and your change has
not been saved.

When editing a Recipient's Phone Number, remember that no two Recipients can have the same
Phone Number. If you attempt to change a Recipient's Phone Number to another Number
already in use, an error will occur and the change will not be made.

Due to the nature of the system, if you make multiple changes to a particular field
in succession without waiting for confirmation that the change has saved, there
is no guarantee that the last change you made will be the change applied. Therefore,
be careful when making multiple rapid edits to a particular field. If a change has
been saved successfully, a small green "Success" box will appear in the bottom left
of the page. This indicates that any future changes you make will be applied *after*
that change.
  
### 4.2.0 Other Attributes

The **Other Attributes** Box includes other, less salient information. Much of this
Box is repeated from the Recipient Table.

* **Recipient ID** is the internal ID Instant Census uses to keep track of a Recipient. This is
  an immutable and completely unique identification that the system uses to keep
  track of the Recipient independent of any other factor.
* **Create Time** indicates the date and time at which a Recipient was added to the Cohort.
* **Status** is the Status of the Recipient. This may be **Pending**, indicating
  Instant Census is waiting for the Recipient to confirm they wish to participate;
  **Active**, indicating a Recipient
  is receiving Messages normally; **Paused**, indicating the Recipient has been paused
  by you; **Inactive**, indicating the Recipient was automatically paused because they
  failed to answer enough **Questions** in a row; or **Disabled**, indicating that 
  a Recipient has requested not to receive any further communication from Instant Census.
* Any further items are **Recipient Attributes**, and the indicated value is the value
  that Recipient has for that Attribute.

You can change the Recipient's Status by clicking on their current status.
If the Recipient is **Active** this will change them to **Paused**. If the Recipient is Paused
this will set them to Active. **Pending**, **Disabled**, and **Inactive** Recipients cannot be changed 
by you. In order to set a Recipient to Disabled, that Recipient must text in 'Stop', and Recipients
only become Inactive when they fail to respond to a certain number of **Questions**
in a row. In order to reactivate a Disabled or Inactive Recipient that Recipient must
send a message to Instant Census. Recipients by default start Pending, and must text
in confirming their desire to join the **Cohort** to be set to Active. By default
Recipients cannot by default add themselves to your deployment. To access this
functionality, please contact [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).

You may also freely edit any of the Recipient's Attributes from here. Simply click the Attribute's
current value and begin editing. Once you have made the edit, clicking away from the it in any 
way will save the changes you have made. A small, green **Saved** message will appear
in the lower left corner of the page to confirm your change has been saved. If you
instead see a red **Error** message, something has gone wrong and your change has
not been saved.

Furthermore, **Recipient Attributes** may not have blank values. If you attempt to change
a Recipient Attribute to be blank, it will automatically be filled with the **Default
Value** for that Attribute. If you would like to indicate that a Recipient does not have
a certain Attribute, use "None", "N/A", or something similar instead.
  
### 4.3.0 Message History

The **Message History** Box provides a comprehensive history of the Messages sent
and received by the Recipient. If the Recipient has any Unhandled Messages, that is, Messages
Instant Census either couldn't understand or wasn't expecting, they are highlighted
here.

In addition to providing a complete conversation history, the Message History Box
can also be used to manually communicate with an individual Recipient. Simply enter text
in the Text Field directly below the Message History, and when you are satisfied
click the green **Send** Button to the right. This will send the Message in the
Text Field to the Recipient. You may only send such Messages to Active, Paused, or Inactive Recipients.
Disabled Recipients may not receive *any* further communications.

### 4.4.0 Other Features

There are three other features you can utilize when on the **Message Sender** Page.
To access them, hover over the **Actions** Dropdown in the top left of the page,
directly beneath the Instant Census logo in the **Navigation Bar**. On the menu
that pops up, simply click the Action you desire to use it.

* **Mark Recipient as Handled** will remove the **Recipient** from the list of Recipients needing
  review on the **Inbox** Page.
* **Next Unhandled Message** will focus the Message History on the next unhandled
  Message for this Recipient. This can allow you to quickly check through the Messages
  sent in by the Recipient which Instant Census didn't know how to handle, and allow
  you to evaluate what (if any) action you wish to take based on them.
* **Download Message History** will automatically download a CSV file containing
  a complete record of the communications between the Recipient and Instant Census.

## 5.0.0 Survey Builder

The **Survey Builder** Page provides the tools to create the Surveys that are to
be sent to **Recipients** on a particular **Cohort**. To access the Survey Builder Page,
click on the **Survey Builder** Button on the Cohorts Page, located in the middle
of the left hand side of the Cohort's Button Panel, for the desired Cohort. If you
are already within a Cohort, you may access the Survey Builder by clicking the Survey
Builder tab in the **Navigation Bar**.

### 5.1.0 Schedules

**Schedules** are the starting point of any Survey. A Schedule indicates the time
or times at which its **Questions** and **Messages** are sent out to Recipients. It indicates
certain kinds of **Resend** behavior for its Questions, and helps organize things
into manageable chunks. Note that if multiple Schedules are set to occur at the 
same time, they will be sent to Recipients one at a time in essentially random order.
Furthermore, later Schedules *will* interrupt earlier, non-completed Schedules.
If a later Schedule has interrupted an earlier Schedule, the most recent outstanding
Question from the previous Schedule will automatically be recent upon the conclusion
of the interrupting Schedule.

#### 5.1.1 Schedule Types

There are three different Types of Schedule. These allow you to control the timing
with which your Messages are sent out. The different Schedule Types can be used
to handle different uses of Surveys, and allow you to ask Recipients Questions at exactly
the times you want.

* **Recurring** Schedules occur on at least a weekly basis. You specify the day
  or days of the week on which you want the Schedule to be sent out, specify the time
  and then every week on those days at that time your Recipients will receive their Messages.
* **One-Time** Schedules happen exactly once, and then never again. You specify
  the date and time for the Schedule to occur, and then it sends on that day, at
  that time.
* **On Recipient Creation** Schedules are sent to Recipients the first time they become eligible
  to receive Messages. These Schedules follow the **Cohort's Welcome Message**, and
  are triggered by the same circumstances. Unlike other Schedule types, you do not
  set a time for these Schedules to occur; they will occur as soon as they can,
  no matter what time it is. Like One-Time Schedules, On Recipient Creation Schedules
  do not repeat.
  
#### 5.1.2 Adding Schedules

In order to add a new Schedule, hover over the **Actions** Dropdown in the upper
left of the page, directly below the Instant Census logo in the **Navigation Bar**.
Then, in the menu that appears, click the **Add Schedule** Button. This will launch
a Popup using which you can configure the options for your new Schedule. If you
decide against creating a new Schedule, you can click the **X** in the top right of the
Popup, or the **Cancel** Button in the bottom right.

This Popup has three tabs, corresponding to the three Types of Schedules. Selecting
the tab corresponding to the Type of Schedule you wish to create will display the
options you need to configure in order to create the Schedule.

For Recurring Schedules:

* The **Send Survey On** Checkboxes allow you to select the day or days of the week
  on which you want the Schedule to be sent. You must select at least one day, and
  may select as many as you want. Simply check the corresponding box to select a
  day. You cannot set this to be a day that has already happened. The earliest day
  you can configure such a Schedule to go out is the current date at time of creation.
* The **Send Questions At** Dropdown allows you to select the time at which you want
  the Schedule to be sent. This may be any time of day, and will be sent to each
  Recipient at that time in their Timezone. While you can send
  Recipients Messages at any time, day or night, bear in mind that your Recipients might not
  want to be disturbed at certain times.
  
For One-Time Schedules:

* The **Send Survey On** field allows you to select the specific day on which you
  wish to send the Survey. This day cannot have already passed; you must select the
  current day or any subsequent, but may not set it for the past.
* The **Send Questions At** Dropdown allows you to select the time at which you want
  the Schedule to be sent. This may be any time of dayand will be sent to each
  Recipient at that time in their Timezone. While you can send
  Recipients Messages at any time, day or night, bear in mind that your Recipients might not
  want to be disturbed at certain times.
  
On Recipient Creation Schedules do not require the configuration of any specific options.
All Schedules, however, including On Recipient Create, have a set of **Resend** attributes
that must be configured.

* The **Resend questions if Recipients text back invalid answer?** Checkbox allows you
  change whether or not improper responses by the Recipient cause the system to prompt
  them to respond correctly. While this will increase the number of Messages sent,
  it can help get you exactly the information you want.
* The **Resend At** Dropdown allows you to select the time at which Surveys will
  be resent. Like the **Send Questions At** field, this value takes into account
  the Timezone of each Recipient. When setting this attribute, you should consider carefully
  the times at which your Recipients are unlikely to want to receive communications.
* The **Resend How Many Times?** field allows you to indicate the number of times
  you wish the Schedule to be resent. If you do not want this Schedule to be resent
  at all, simply set this value to 0.

These last two variables set a Resend which will be sent in the event that a Recipient
fails to respond to a Question on that Schedule. The next time the Resend At hour
occurs, if a Recipient has not answered a Question on this Schedule, they will be
resent their most recent Question. This will happen a number of times equal to the
Resend How Many Times? Value. Note that if the Resend At time is after the time 
the Schedule is normally sent out, the Recipient will receive the resend on the same
day as the regular Schedule.
  
Once you are satisfied with the configuration of your Schedule, click the **Add
Schedule** Button in the bottom right of the Popup. This will create a new Schedule
with the indicated attributes. Bear in mind that you can edit a Schedule any time
you want.

#### 5.1.3 Editing Schedules

You may edit a Schedule at any time. To do so, simply click on the Schedule. This
will launch a Popup, pre-populated with the Schedule's current attributes, that
you can use to change those attributes. If you decide against editing the Schedule,
either click the **X** at the top right of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button at the
bottom right.

The Popup has three tabs, corresponding to the three Types of Schedule. Using these
tabs, you can change the Type of the Schedule to whichever you desire. However, if
you convert any Schedule to an **On Recipient Create** Schedule, it will not send to
existing, on-boarded **Recipients**. It will only send to new Recipients created *after* the
editing of this Schedule.

Clicking any of the tabs will bring up the inputs necessary to change the attributes
of a Schedule of that Type.

For Recurring Schedules:

* The **Send Survey On** Checkboxes allow you to select the day or days of the week
  on which you want the Schedule to be sent. You must select at least one day, and
  may select as many as you want. Simply check the corresponding box to select a
  day.
* The **Send Questions At** Dropdown allows you to select the time at which you want
  the Schedule to be sent. This may be any time of day, and will be sent to each
  Recipient at that time in their Timezone. While you can send
  Recipients Messages at any time, day or night, bear in mind that your Recipients might not
  want to be disturbed at certain times.
  
For One-Time Schedules:

* The **Send Survey On** field allows you to select the specific day on which you
  wish to send the Survey. This day cannot have already passed; you must select the
  current day or any subsequent, but may not set it for the past.
* The **Send Questions At** Dropdown allows you to select the time at which you want
  the Schedule to be sent. This may be any time of day, and will be sent to each
  Recipient at that time in their Timezone.While you can send
  Recipients Messages at any time, day or night, bear in mind that your Recipients might not
  want to be disturbed at certain times.
  
On Recipient Creation Schedules do not have any specific options you may configure. All
of these Schedule Types, however, including On Recipient Creation Schedules, have a set
of **Resend** attributes that you may change.

* The **Resend questions if Recipients text back invalid answer?** Checkbox allows you
  change whether or not improper responses by the Recipient cause the system to prompt
  them to respond correctly. While this will increase the number of Messages sent,
  it can help get you exactly the information you want.
* The **Resend At** Dropdown allows you to select the time at which Surveys will
  be resent. Like the **Send Questions At** field, this value will take into consideration
  each Recipient's Timezone. However, you should still think carefully about what time
  your Recipients are likely to be receptive to communication.
* The **Resend How Many Times?** field allows you to indicate the number of times
  you wish the Schedule to be resent. If you do not want this Schedule to be resent
  at all, simply set this value to 0.

These last two variables set a Resend which will be sent in the event that a Recipient
fails to respond to a Question on that Schedule. The next time the Resend At hour
occurs, if a Recipient has not answered a Question on this Schedule, they will be
resent their most recent Question. This will happen a number of times equal to the
Resend How Many Times? Value. Note that if the Resend At time is after the time 
the Schedule is normally sent out, the Recipient will receive the resend on the same
day as the regular Schedule.

Once you are satisfied with the configuration of your Schedule, click the **Edit
Schedule** Button in the bottom right of the Popup. This alters the Schedule to have
the attributes you set. You may alter a Schedule as many times as you want. 

It is important to remember that if you edit a Schedule while a Recipient is in the middle
of responding to that Schedule, this can lead to bizarre behaviors. This is not just
limited to changing send times (although this can lead to significant trouble) but
also adding/removing Questions and branches in logic. In general, you should try
to avoid editing Schedules that could possibly be in progress. If you edit the send
date and time of a One-Time Schedule that has already been sent so that it is in
the future, that Schedule will be sent again on the new date.

#### 5.1.4 Resends

**Resends** are repetitions of Messages that have already been sent. Under certain
circumstances, configurable on the **Schedule** level, the same Message may be sent
multiple times. There are two reasons that this might happen.

* If a Recipient responds inappropriately to a **Question**, they may receive a resend
  prompting them to respond correctly. So, for instance, if you asked a Recipient to
  rate something between 1 and 5, and they responded "7", they could receive a resend
  restating the Question and reiterating that they should respond with a number
  between 1 and 5.
* If a Recipient fails to respond at all, they may be sent a Resend simply restating
  the Question to prompt them to resume answering. This can serve as a reminder to
  a Recipient that they have a Survey which they simply forgot about or failed to notice
  the first time.
  
The former kind of Resend can be switched on and off by checking or unchecking (respectively)
the **Resend questions if Recipients text back invalid answer?** Checkbox in the Schedule
Creation or Schedule Editing Popup. It cannot be customized in any other way.

The latter kind of Resend requires slightly more complex configuration, and are also
set up in the Schedule Creation or Schedule Editing Popup. Such Resends are scheduled
to occur at a specific time in the **Resend At** field of the Popup. This is the
time at which Instant Census will check to see if Recipients
have uncompleted Schedules. Furthermore, the number of times you wish this to happen
must be specified in the **Resend How Many Times?** field. This is the number of
times Instant Census will Resend that Schedule before allowing it to go unanswered.
Thus, if you have a Resend set to happen at 5pm three times, the next three times
it is 5pm EST the Recipient will be resent their currently active Question for that Schedule.
If a Recipient has completed a Schedule, and has no outstanding Questions from it, then
Resends will not happen.

Independent of the foregoing, Questions will automatically be resent if an incomplete
schedule is interrupted, and the interrupting Schedule is completed. If this happens,
the most recent unanswered Question from the interrupted Schedule will be resent,
allowing the Recipient to resume the interrupted Schedule. It is important to remember
that this resend will occur *immediately* upon completion of the interrupting Schedule,
causing the resent Question to occur within the context of a *different* Schedule.
It is therefore important that you word everything so that these different occurences
will not elicit improper responses from the Recipients.

Resends have priority over ordinary Schedules. That is, if you have a Schedule that
occurs every Tuesday at 6pm, and a Schedule from Monday that resends at 6pm, the
Resend will occur before the new Schedule. If there are multiple Resends set to
occur at the same time, their order will be random.

Because Resends only send out the most recent unanswered Question to a Recipient, they
have some ramifications for how Questions ought to be worded. In particular, if
you wish to use Resend functionality, it is important to word Questions so that
they make sense *without* the rest of their associated Schedule preceding them.
If Questions are not written so that they make sense out of context from the rest
of their Schedule, this will cause confusion and improper responses among your Recipients.

#### 5.1.5 Items Dependent on Schedules

The primary value of Schedules is providing a timeframe on which other, more active
things can occur. These dependent Items must be attached, either directly or indirectly
to a Schedule. To add an Item to a Schedule click the blue **+** Button to the right
of the Schedule. This will launch a Popup from which you can add Items to the Schedule
If you decide against adding an Item to a Schedule, click the **X** in the top right
of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button on the bottom right.

You may add any of the other Item Types to the Schedule. Simply click on the tab
at the top of the Popup corresponding to the type of Item you wish to create. This
will automatically display the correct fields to configure an Item of that Type.
Once you are satisfied with the Item, click the **Add New Item** Button at the bottom
right of the Popup. This will create a new Item with the selected attributes. 

Items added to a Schedule occur in order of appearance below the Schedule.
Thus, Items higher up on the page occur before Items lower down. To change an Item's
position, click the Up or Down arrow directly to the right of the Item. This will
move the Item, as well as any Items that may be dependent upon that Item, either
up or down. Thus, when a Schedule occurs, it will immediately perform whatever action
is required by the first Item attached to it and continue on until there are no
more Items. This direct progress through the Items has two noteworthy exceptions.

* If you send multiple **Messages** in a row, or any Messages and a **Question**,
  there is no guarantee that they will arrive in the desired order. While Instant
  Census takes a number of measures to increase the liklihood that they will be
  received correctly, the nature of SMS as a medium means it is never 100% certain
  that such communications will appear to Recipients in the order they are sent out.
* As soon as you send a Question, the Schedule pauses until the Recipient responds to
  the Question. As soon as the Recipient has responded, the Schedule will continue on
  as normal. 
  
If you wish to hide the Items attached to a Schedule, you can click the arrow to
the left of the Schedule. This will hide all the Items dependent on the Schedule.
Clicking the arrow again will reveal them once more.

#### 5.1.6 Copying Schedules

The <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-copy" aria-hidden="true"></span> (Copy Schedule)
Button to the right of the Schedule allows you to transfer a Schedule from one Cohort
to another. When you click this Button, it will launch a Popup asking you to indicate
to which Cohort you would like to copy the Schedule. Once you have selected to Cohort 
to which you would like to transfer the Schedule, click the **Copy Schedule** Button 
in the lower right to make the transfer. If you decide against copying the Schedule, 
click the **X** Button in the top right, the **Cancel** Button next to the Copy 
Schedule Button, or simply click anywhere outside the Popup.

Note that you can copy a Schedule to a Cohort in which it already exists. In such
a case, you will create a second exact duplicate of your Schedule within the same
Cohort. While this can have it's uses, be careful to make sure that you do not leave
both these Schedules set to occur at the same time, or your Users will get the same
exact survey twice in a row.

In order to successfully copy a Schedule, you must ensure that any **Custom Attributes**
used in that Schedule (in **Set Attributes**, **Conditionals**, **Question** text
and **Message** text) exist in the Cohort to which you are moving the Schedule. If
they do not, Instant Census will be unable to copy the Schedule. You will get an
error, and need to add the appropriate Attributes to the new Cohort.

#### 5.1.7 Testing Schedules

By clicking on the <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-blackboard" aria-hidden="true"></span> 
(**Test Schedule**) button, you can send your Schedule out to a few Recipients outside
the normal timing of the Schedule. This lets you, for example, beta test Schedules
on particular users, or just send your Schedule to yourself to make sure the logic
works as intended. 

When you click this button, a Popup will launch allowing you to enter the Recipients
you wish to test the Schedule on. Simply begin entering the Recipient's phone number
in the box. Do not use any parentheses, hyphens, or spaces when entering the number.
A list of Recipients currently on the Cohort will autofill based on what you have
entered, allowing you to select the correct Recipient. Once you entered the Recipient,
simply click enter or click away from the input. This will add the Recipient to
the list of Test Recipients. Once you have thus indicated all the Recipients with
whom you wish to test the Schedule, click the **Test Schedule** Button in the bottom
right of the Popup to send out the selected Schedule to the indicated Recipients.
Note that this will interrupt any Schedules they have currently ongoing, and will
not stop them from also receiving the Schedule at the normal time.

If you decide against sending out a test of the Schedule, you can click the **X**
in the top right or the **Cancel** Button to the left of the Test Schedule Button
to dismiss the Popup and continue on without sending the test. You can also click
anywhere outside the Popup.

### 5.2.0 Questions

**Questions** are how you actively solicit information from **Recipients**. They form
the backbone of Schedules, allowing you to automatically ask your Recipient for information.
They can also form the basis for sub-groupings of Questions, **Messages**, and other
Items, allowing you to ask people only the most important things based on their
particular traits. 

#### 5.2.1 Types

There are four different **Types** of **Question**. Each allows you to ask a different
kind of Question, and indicate a different set of Expected Responses from a **Recipient**.
You can use these Expected Responses to customize each Recipient's experience based on
the information they have already given you, eliminating the need to ask every Recipient
every Question, even those that do not apply to them.

* **Open-Ended** Questions are Questions that are too broad to be able to predict
  how a Recipient will respond. While this means responses to this Question Type are
  less useful than others, it can be a good way to ask broad or vague questions.
  Anything a Recipient sends back as a response to an Open-Ended Question will be accepted
  by the system, without further analysis or parsing.
* **Yes/No** Questions are those which require a binary response of, as their name
  implies, either "yes" or "no". Any response a Recipient sends back to such a Question
  will be analyzed to see if it could be one or the other. If it could, then the
  appropriate response is logged by the system. Any answer that cannot be so construed
  is logged as an 'Unhandled Response', and the Recipient may be prompted to re-respond,
  depending on the configuration of the **Schedule**.
* **Multiple Choice** Questions expect one of a finite number of possible responses.
  You must indicate how many options there are, and what those options are, when
  you create such a Question. Recipient responses are then compared with the possible
  choices, and if there is a match that is logged by the system. Otherwise, the
  response is logged as an 'Unhandled Response', and the Recipient may be prompted to re-respond,
  depending on the configuration of the Schedule.
* **Numeric** Questions expect an answer that is a number within a particular range.
  You must set the minimum and the maximum possible value for an answer when you
  create a Question of this Type. Currently, negative numbers are not supported,
  and 2,147,483,647 is the maximum possible value for such a number. Instant Census
  will attempt to read any response by the Recipient as a number, and if successful log
  that response. Otherwise, the   response is logged as an 'Unhandled Response', 
  and the Recipient may be prompted to re-respond, depending on the configuration of 
  the Schedule.

#### 5.2.2 Adding Questions

To add a Question to a **Schedule**, click the **+** to the right of the Item of which you 
want the Question to be a Dependent Item, either the Schedule itself or a **Conditional**.
This will launch a Popup allowing you to configure the necessary details of the
Question. Make sure the Question Tab is the active Tab at the top of the Popup.
If you decide against creating a new Question, simply click the **X** at the top right
of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button at the bottom right.

* Every Question requires you to enter the text of the Question in the **Question
  Text** field. This is text of the Message that will get sent to the **Recipient** when this
  Question is asked. For the best Recipient experience, you should make sure that the
  Text makes clear what kind of Question this is. The length of the Text of a Question
  cannot exceed 160 characters.
* The **Question Type** field allows you to select the **Type** of the Question.
  When you make this selection, a new set of fields will appear allowing you fill
  out the other necessary information for that Question Type.
  
Each Question Type requires different information in order to create a Question.
When you set or change the Question Type Dropdown, the necessary fields will appear
immediately below. **Open-Ended** and **Yes/No** Questions do not have any additional 
required information. All that is required is the Text of the Question and identification
of its Type.

**Multiple Choice** Questions require three additional pieces of information.

* The **Append Choices to SMS?** Checkbox allows you to automatically append a list
  of the valid choices to the end of the Message. If this option is selected for
  a Question, the text of this appendix will be displayed alongside the regular
  Text of the Question. Bear in mind that if you do this, the length of the Message
  may exceed 160 characters, and thus require more than one Message to send. If
  multiple Messages are required, there is no guarantee they will be received by
  the Recipient in the correct order.
* The **Number of Choices** field lets you indicate how many choices you are setting
  for this Question. This number must be at least 1, and cannot exceed 2,147,483,647.
* The **Choices** fields must each contain the text of a particular Choice for the
  Question. The Recipient's response will be compared to each of these Choices, and only
  if there is an exact match (capitalization notwithstanding) will a Recipient's response
  be considered correct. Each field *must* have answer text put in it. If you elect
  to have the Choices automatically appended to the message, it is each of these 
  values which will be put at the end of the Message.
  
**Numeric** Questions require two additional pieces of information.

* The **Minimum** is the minimum possible number value of a valid Recipient response.
  While this number may be zero, it cannot be negative.
* The **Maximum** is the maximum possible number value of a valid Recipient response.
  This number *must* be higher than the Minimum value.

Thus, a valid Recipient response to a Numeric Question is any value between the Minimum
and Maximum, inclusive. It is also worth noting that the maximum possible value
for either field is 2,147,483,647.
  

#### 5.2.3 Editing Questions

If you wish to edit the Text of a **Question**, you can simply click on the Question
Text as displayed in the **Survey Builder**. This will let you edit the Message
a **Recipient** will see when they reach that part of the **Schedule**. However, this *will not* change
any other attributes of the Question, just the Text. A Question edited in this way
will retain its Type, possible answers, and any other configurable attribute. Once
you are done editing the Question Text, simply click away from the Text and it will
automatically be saved. You cannot edit the Question's Text to be more than 160
characters.

You may edit a Question's Text in this way as many times as you want. However,
due to the nature of the system, if you make multiple changes to the same Question
in succession without waiting for confirmation that the change has saved, there
is no guarantee that the last change you made will be the last change applied. Therefore,
be careful when making multiple rapid edits to a particular Question. If a change has
been saved successfully, a small green 'Success' box will appear in the bottom left
of the page. This indicates that any future changes you make will be applied *after*
that change.

If you wish to edit any of the other attributes of a Question, click on the parenthetical
listing of the Question's attributes located to the right of the Question Text.
This will launch a Popup from which you can edit the various options for the Question.
This Popup will automatically be populated with the current values for the Question.
If you decide against editing the Item, simply click the **X** in the top right of the
Popup, or the **Cancel** Button in the bottom right. This will discard your changes
without saving them.

* The **Text** field allows you to edit the Text of the Question as it will be sent
  to the Recipient. This cannot exceed 160 characters.
* The **Question Type** field allows you to change the **Type** of the Question.
  When you make this selection, a new set of fields will appear allowing you fill
  out the other necessary information for that Question Type.

Each Question Type has different configurable attributes. When you change the Question 
Type Dropdown, the fields allowing you to change these values will appear immediately 
below. **Open-Ended** and **Yes/No** Questions do not have any additional configurable
attributes. All that is used for these Questions are the Text and the Type.

**Multiple Choice** Questions have three additional configurable attributes.

* The **Append Choices to SMS?** Checkbox allows you to automatically append a list
  of the valid choices to the end of the Message. If this option is selected for
  a Question, the text of this appendix will be displayed alongside the regular
  Text of the Question. Bear in mind that if you do this, the length of the Message
  may exceed 160 characters, and thus require more than one Message to send. If
  multiple Messages are required, there is no guarantee they will be received by
  the Recipient in the correct order.
* The **Number of Choices** field lets you indicate how many choices you are setting
  for this Question. This number must be at least 1, and cannot exceed 2,147,483,647.
* The **Choices** fields must each contain the text of a particular Choice for the
  Question. The Recipient's response will be compared to each of these Choices, and only
  if there is an exact match (capitalization notwithstanding) will a Recipient's response
  be considered correct. Each field *must* have answer text put in it. If you elect
  to have the Choices automatically appended to the message, it is each of these 
  values which will be put at the end of the Message.
  
**Numeric** Questions have two additional configurable options.

* The **Minimum** is the minimum possible number value of a valid Recipient response.
  While this number may be zero, it cannot be negative.
* The **Maximum** is the maximum possible number value of a valid Recipient response.
  This number *must* be higher than the Minimum value.

Thus, a valid Recipient response to a Numeric Question is any value between the Minimum
and Maximum, inclusive. It is also worth noting that the maximum possible value
for either field is 2,147,483,647.

Once you are satisfied with the edits you have made to the Question, click the 
**Edit Item** Button in the bottom right of the Popup. Bear in mind that you can
edit a Question as many times as you want.

#### 5.2.4 Items Dependent on Questions

Like a **Schedule**, Dependent Items may be attached to **Questions**. Unlike Schedules,
however, which may have any Type of Item attached to them, Questions can only have
**Conditional** or **Set Attribute** Items attached to them. This is because any
Item attached to a Question must interact with the answer to that Question. This
also means that Conditionals and Set Attributes attached to Questions behave slightly
differently from their ordinary counterparts.

To add an Item to a Question, click the purple **+** to the right of the Question to
which you wish to add the Item. This will launch a Popup using which you can setup
the Item. If you decide against adding the Item, simply click the **X** in the top right
of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button in the bottom right.

As with any Item addition, the first thing in the Popup is a tab that allows you
to select the Type of Item you wish to add. Your only two options will be Conditional
and Set Attribute. Once you have selected which you wish to add, the necessary fields
to configure that Type of Item will appear. However, in each case your choices will
be constrained.

* If you are adding a Conditional, the first part must include the answer to the Question.
  That is, Conditionals attached to Questions must be of the form "If {{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}
  is __________________________________".
* If you are adding a Set Attribute, the second part must include the answer to the
  Question. That is, Set Attributes attached to Questions must be of the form "Set
  __________________________________ to {{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}".

In both cases, the answer is the particular answer given by each Recipient, and thus
its actual value will vary from Recipient to Recipient. 

Items dependent on a Question will occur in order from the Question. You can reorder
these items by clicking the Up or Down arrow to the right of the Item. This will
move the Item Up or Down in order respectively. You cannot put an Item dependent
on a Question *above* the Question on which it depends. Furthermore, you cannot
move such an Item from dependence on the Question to dependence on something else.

### 5.3.0 Messages

**Messages** are texts sent out to Recipients that do not anticipate a response from
the Recipient. This differentiates them from **Questions**, which are meant to prompt
a response from a Recipient. Messages can be used when you wish to communicate some information
to Recipients, but do not want them to send information in return. For this reason, it
is important to word Messages in such a way as to make clear to Recipients that they
are not expected to respond. If a Recipient responds to a Message, their response will
be classified as an "Unhandled Response".

It is also important to think very carefully about usage and placement of Questions.
In particular, if multiple Messages are sent in a row, or a Message is sent directly
before a Question, there is no guarantee that the Recipient will receive these communications
in the order they are sent out. This is a limitation of all SMS systems. Consequently,
you should be aware that if you send multiple Messages in a row, they could be received
in any order, and Messages meant to precede Questions may, in fact, follow them.
This last behavior can be particularly troublesome, as it may make Recipients less likely
to respond to the Question.

#### 5.3.1 Adding Messages

To add a **Message**, click the + Button to the right of the Item on which you want
the Message to be dependent. This may be a **Schedule** or a **Conditional**. Once
you have done so, a Popup will appear allowing you to add an Item. Click on the
tab labeled **Message** at the top of the Popup. This will display a field in which
you should enter the Text of the Message. This is the Text that will be sent to 
each Recipient who receives the Message. A Message cannot be longer than 160 characters.
Once you are satisfied with the Message's Text, click the **Add Item** Button on 
the bottom right of the Popup. Bear in mind that you can edit a Message at any time. 
If you ultimately decide against adding the Message, simply click the **X** at the top 
right of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button on the bottom right.

#### 5.3.2 Editing Messages

In order to edit a **Message**, simply click on the Text of the Message as displayed
in the **Survey Builder**. This will allow you to directly edit the Text of the
Message. You may save your changes by clicking away from the Text. You cannot edit
a Message to be longer than 160 characters.

You may edit a Message's Text in this way as many times as you want. However,
due to the nature of the system, if you make multiple changes to the same Message
in succession without waiting for confirmation that the change has saved, there
is no guarantee that the last change you made will be the last change applied. Therefore,
be careful when making multiple rapid edits to a particular Message. If a change has
been saved successfully, a small green 'Success' box will appear in the bottom left
of the page. This indicates that any future changes you make will be applied *after*
that change.

### 5.4.0 Conditionals

**Conditional** is an item Type that allows you to tailor the behavior of a Survey
to the particular details of a particular **Recipient**. They allow you to skip portions
of a **Schedule** for Recipients to whom that portion doesn't apply, and funnel Recipients
through a Schedule so you get the most important information out of each person 
based on what you already know about them.

Conditionals all take the form of "If __________________________________ is
__________________________________". The first blank will generally be a **Recipient 
Attribute**, while the second blank can be anything. This works slightly differently 
if the Conditional is dependent on a **Question**. In that case, the first blank
will always be "{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}". Any Item that is then attached to the Conditional will
only occur for a Recipient if the value of the first blank is the same as the value of 
the second blank for that Recipient. If the first blank is "{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}", it will check against
the value of the response just sent in by the Recipient. Thus, you create a sub-portion 
of the Schedule that will only happen for Recipients for whom the Conditional is true.

#### 5.4.1 Adding Conditionals

To add a **Conditional**, click the **+** Button to the right of the Item on which you 
want the Conditional to be dependent. This may be a **Schedule**, **Question**, or 
another Conditional. This will launch a Popup allowing you to configure the
options to add an Item to that Item. If you decide against creating the Conditional,
simply click the **X** at the top right of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button at the
bottom right.

To add a Conditional with the Popup, you must first select the **Conditional** tab
at the top of the Popup. This will automatically display the fields required to set
up a new Conditional.

If you are adding it to a Schedule or Conditional, there will be a Dropdown from
which you must select the **Recipient Attribute** of which you wish to check the Recipient's
Value. If you are adding it to a Question, this will automatically be filled with
"{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}", and the Conditional *must* check the value of the Recipient's answer to the
preceding Question.

Next, there is a blank text field in which you must put the value you wish to compare
the first item against. You must enter this text *exactly* as you wish it to be
compared, and if the Conditional is being added to a Question you should take care
to ensure that this value is precisely the same as one of the valid responses to
the preceding Question.

#### 5.4.2 Editing Conditionals

Editing a **Conditional** can be done directly from the **Survey Builder** page.

* To change the attribute to be checked, simply click it on the Conditional. This
  will open a Dropdown menu from which you can select any of the existing **Recipient
  Attributes**. Once you select a new Attribute, the system will automatically save
  your change. If the Conditional depends on a **Question**, however, this value
  cannot be changed from "{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}". Conditionals Dependent on Questions *must* check
  against the value of a Recipient's answer to that Question.
* To edit the value against which the attribute is checked, click that value on the
  Conditional. This will allow you to directly edit the Text of the value. If you
  are editing a Conditional attached to a Question, remember to make sure that this
  value *precisely* matches one of the valid answers to the Question. If it does not,
  the Conditional will always be treated as false.

You may edit a Conditional as many times as you want, whenever you want. However,
due to the nature of the system, if you make multiple changes to the same variable
of the same Conditional in succession without waiting for confirmation that the 
change has saved, there is no guarantee that the last change you made will be the 
last change applied. Therefore, be careful when making multiple rapid edits to a 
particular variable of a particular Conditional. If a change has been saved successfully, 
a small green 'Success' box will appear in the bottom left of the page. This indicates 
that any future changes you make will be applied *after* that change.

#### 5.4.3 Items Dependent on Conditionals

Much like **Schedules**, the prime use of **Conditionals** is as something to which
other Items can be attached. In particular, since Items attached to a Conditional
only occur if the Conditional is true, it allows you to automatically alter what
a Recipient sees in their Survey depending on what you already know about that Recipient.

To add an Item to a Conditional, click the orange + to the right of the Conditional.
This will laucnh a Popup allowing you to configure the attributes of the new Item.
If you decide against adding a new Item to the Conditional, click the **X** at the top
right of the Popup or the **Cancel** Button on the bottom right.

You may add any of the other Item Types to the Conditional. Simply click on the tab
at the top of the Popup corresponding to the type of Item you wish to create. This
will automatically display the correct fields to configure an Item of that Type.
Once you are satisfied with the Item, click the **Add New Item** Button at the bottom
right of the Popup. This will create a new Item with the selected attributes. 

Items added to a Conditional occur roughly in order of appearance below the Conditional.
Thus, Items higher up on the page occur before Items lower down. To change an Item's
position, click the Up or Down arrow directly to the right of the Item. This will
move the Item, as well as any Items that may be dependent upon that Item, either
up or down. You cannot put an Item dependent on a Question *above* the Conditional 
on which it depends. Furthermore, you cannot move such an Item from dependence on 
the Conditional to dependence on something else.

### 5.5.0 Set Attribute

The **Set Attribute** Item Type allows you to automatically change the value of
one of a Recipient's **Recipient Attributes** during a **Schedule**. By doing so, you can
store information gleaned from one Schedule, and use it in either the same or a 
later Schedule to hone the Recipient's experience.

Set Attributes take the form of "Set __________________________________ to
__________________________________". Typically, the first blank is filled with the
Recipient Attribute of which you wish to set the value, and the second blank is filled
with the new value you want it to have. If the Set Attribute is attached to a **Question**,
however, then the second blank must be "{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}", and will set the Attribute to have
the value of the response the Recipient sent to the preceding Question.

#### 5.5.1 Adding Set Attributes

To add a **Set Attribute**, click the + Button to the right of the Item on which you 
want the Set Attribute to be dependent. This may be a **Schedule**, **Question**, or 
**Conditional**. This will launch a Popup allowing you to configure the options 
to add an Item to that Item. If you decide against creating the Set Attribute, simply 
click the **X** at the top right of the Popup, or the **Cancel** Button at the bottom 
right.

Once you have opened the Popup, click the **Set Attribute** tab to bring up the
options you need to configure to create the new Set Attribute.

* You must select one of the **Recipient Attributes** for this Cohort. This Attribute
  is the Attribute that will be changed when this Set Attribute occurs. You must
  select one of the existing Recipient Attributes from the Dropdown in the Popup.
* You may enter any value to fill the second blank by typing it in the Text Field.
  This is the *exact* value to which the Recipient Attribute will be set when this Set
  Attribute occurs. If the Set Attribute is attached to a Question, you cannot edit
  this field. Instead, it *must* be "{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}", and will set the Recipient Attribute to
  whatever answer the Recipient gave to the preceding Question.
  
Once you have configured the Set Attribute, click the **Add Item** Button on the
bottom right of the Popup. Bear in mind that you can edit the Set Attribute at any
time, and as many times as you want.  

#### 5.5.2 Editing Set Attributes

Editing a **Set Attribute** can be done directly from the **Survey Builder** page.

* To change the Attribute to be set, simply click it on the Set Attribute. This
  will open a Dropdown menu from which you can select any of the existing **Recipient
  Attributes**. Once you select a new Attribute, the system will automatically save
  your change.
* To edit the value to which the Attribute is set, click that value on the Set
  Attribute. This will allow you to directly edit the Text of the value. If you
  are editing a Set Attribute attached to a **Question**, you cannot edit this value.
  It will always be "{{ ANSWER_VALUE_DISPLAY }}", and will set the Attribute to the Recipient's response to
  the Question.

You may edit a Set Attribute as many times as you want, whenever you want. However,
due to the nature of the system, if you make multiple changes to the same variable
of the same Set Attribute in succession without waiting for confirmation that the 
change has saved, there is no guarantee that the last change you made will be the 
last change applied. Therefore, be careful when making multiple rapid edits to a 
particular variable of a particular Set Attribute. If a change has been saved successfully, 
a small green 'Success' box will appear in the bottom left of the page. This indicates 
that any future changes you make will be applied *after* that change.

### 5.6.0 Other Features

In addition to the features outlined above, there are a few additional actions possible
on the **Survey Builder** Page, allowing you to interact with Items and Surveys.

#### 5.6.1 Deleting Items

If you wish to remove an Item from your Survey entirely, click the pink **X** located
to the right of the Item. This will launch a Popup asking you to confirm that you
wish to delete the Item. This Popup also lists any other Items that will automatically
be deleted as a result of the deletion of the selected Item. If you decide against
deleting the Item, click the **X** in the top right of the Popup, or the **Cancel**
Button in the bottom right.

If you are sure you would like to delete the Item, click the **Delete** Button at
the bottom right of the Popup. Bear in mind that, as the Popup will indicate, when
you delete an Item, all the Items dependent on it will also be deleted automatically.
This means, for instance, that if you wish to delete an entire **Schedule**, you
need only click the **X** next to the Schedule itself, and every Item on that Schedule
will automatically be deleted as well.

#### 5.6.2 Moving Items

Since Items attached to a Schedule will occur in vertical order, starting at the top
and working down, you must arrange Items in the correct order for your Schedule to
occur as intended. This can be achieved using the Up and Down Arrows located to
the right of an Item.

Clicking the Up Arrow will move the Item up the list, above whatever immediately
precedes it, and thus put it earlier in the Schedule.

Clicking the Down Arrow will move the Item down the list, below whatever immediately
precedes it, and thus put it later in the Schedule.

When using these Arrows, note that Items move in groups based on dependency. E.g.,
if you move a **Question** with three **Conditionals** dependent on it, those Conditionals
will travel with the Question and remain dependent on it. Likewise, moving an Item
does not change the Item on which it depends.

#### 5.6.3 Syntax Highlighting

By default, the **Survey Builder** has Syntax Highlighting. That is, different types
of Items and the different parts thereof are displayed in different colors to help
you identify them at a glance and find the part with which you need to interact.
In the event that you find this distracting, or dislike it for any other reason,
you may turn this feature off. Hover over the **Actions** Dropdown in the top left
of the Page, directly below the Instant Census logo in the **Navigation Bar**. From
the menu that appears, select **Toggle Syntax Highlighting**. This will turn Syntax
Highlighting off. If you later decide you would like to turn Syntax Highlighting
back on, repeat the process.

The scheme employed for the Syntax Highlighting is as follows:

* **Schedules** are in blue, and at a larger font size than anything else
* Items that result in Messages being sent to **Recipients** are indicated in purple.
* Items that do not result in Messages being to Recipients are indicated with orange.
* Fields and variables that are editable directly from the Survey Builder page are
  in grey, and further have a grey underline.
* Additional information about **Questions** is in green. This can also be clicked
  to launch the full Question editing Popup.

#### 5.6.4 Print Surveys

If you wish to print a copy of your Survey logic for later use or dissemination,
you may do so from the **Actions** menu. Hover over the Actions Dropdown in the
top right of the Page, directly below the Instant Census logo in the **Navigation
Bar**. From the menu that appears, select **Print Surveys**. This will launch a print
menu from which you can print the Survey as you would any other document. The precise
configuration and usage of this print menu will vary depending on the operating
system and browser you are using; consult their documentation for more information
about their use.

#### 5.6.5 Preview Question/Message

To the right of the Up/Down Arrows next to a **Question** or **Message** is the Preview Button.
Clicking this will show you how the Question or Message will appear for each **Recipient**
on your **Cohort** by filling in any **Recipient Attributes** in the Message text
with the current appropriate value for that Recipient. This lets you double check
that your Message will display correctly for Recipients, and that inserting a Recipient
Attribute will not push the Message length above the 160 Character Limit.

### 5.7.0 Recipient Attributes & Surveys

**Recipient Attributes** allow you to get specific details about particular **Recipients**
automatically as that Recipient takes a Survey, and leverage those details to provide
them a better experience and yourself with more information.
Every Recipient in a particular **Cohort** has the same set of Recipient Attributes,
but each Recipient may have different value for that Attribute. Furthermore, each Recipient
Attribute has a **Default Value** set at time of creation which serves as the Attribute
value for any Recipient on the Cohort who has not had the Attribute explicitly set. These
values can then be check, and set, by Surveys to guide the course of questioning.

#### 5.7.1 Creating Recipient Attributes

In order to create a Recipient Attribute from the **Survey Builder** Page, hover over
the Dropdown labeled **Actions**, directly below the Instant Census logo in the
**Navigation Bar**. Then, in the menu that appears, click on the **Add Recipient Attribute**
Button. This will launch a Popup using which you can create the Recipient Attribute.
If you decide against creating a new Recipient Attribute, simply click the **X** in the top
right of the Popup, or the Cancel Button in the bottom left.

* In the Name field put the Name of the Attribute. This is the label under which the
  Attribute will be listed in the Recipient Table. Each Recipient Attribute must have a unique
  name, so make sure this value is not shared by any existing Attributes.
* In the Default Value field, put the value you want the attribute to have by default.
  Any Recipients already in the system when you create this Recipient Attribute will automatically
  have the Default Value as their value for this Attribute. Any Recipients created subsequently
  will automatically have this assigned as their value for this Attribute.
  
Once you are satisfied with the Name and Default Value of the Recipient Attribute, clicking
**Add Recipient Attribute** at the bottom right of the Popup will create an attribute
with that name, and assign the Default Value to all existing Recipients.

#### 5.7.2 Using Recipient Attributes in Survey Logic

Once you have a set of **Recipient Attributes**, you may use them to help hone your Surveys.
This is done with the two non-Message-sending Item Types, the **Conditional** and
**Set Attribute**.

* Conditionals allow you to create subsets of a **Schedule** which only occur if
  a certain Recipient Attribute has a particular value for a Recipient. This can allow you
  to skip portions of a Survey that are not relevant to certain people. By automatically
  skipping Questions and Messages that don't apply to particular people, you can
  keep them answering the Questions that are of maximum value to you as a researcher.
* Set Attributes allow you to dynamically set the value of Recipient Attributes based
  on Recipient behavior within a Survey. This is how you can set the details you have 
  gleaned about Recipients and make them available for later reference.
  
Combining these two Items allows you to create an adaptive, automated Survey for
your Recipients. By Setting Attributes ahead of time and planning conditionals carefully,
you can automatically have a Recipient take a Survey that takes into account not just
how they just answered the immediate Question, but how they have responded to other
Questions in the past.

#### 5.7.3 Inserting Recipient Attributes into Messages

The value of **Recipient Attributes** can also be inserted directly into Messages sent
to Recipients, creating communications that have a more personalized feel than conventional
automated SMS services. 

To add a Recipient Attribute to the text of a Message, simply enclose the Attribute in 
double square brackets. So, for example, if you wanted to send a greeting message
using a Recipient's name (which you already have as a Recipient Attribute), you would write
the Message's text as "Greetings, [[Name]]". When the text is sent out to each Recipient,
Instant Census will automatically match the contents of the brackets to the Recipient
Attribute of the same name for that Recipient. If a Recipient does not have their own value
for that particular attribute, the Default will be used instead. Bear in mind that
the contents of the brackets must match the desired Recipient Attribute *exactly* (it
*is* case sensitive). If you attempt to insert a Recipient Attribute that does not exist,
an error will occur.

You may add such an insertion either when you first create the **Question** or
**Message**, or through any subsequent edit. However, when adding Recipient Attributes
to the body of a Message, you should be careful about the length of the value. If,
when the Message is about to be sent, the addition of a Recipient Attribute would make
the length of the Message greater than 160 characters, that Message will be split
into multiple Messages. This can lead to problems, since the nature of SMS means
that there is no guarantee the first Message sent out will be the first received.
Thus, your Recipient could end up with a jumbled and incomprehensible Message.

## 6.0.0 Inbox

The **Inbox** Page allows you to see the Messages **Recipients** your deployment
is configured to flag as needing review. To reach this page, click on the **Needs
Review** tab in the **Navigation Bar**. If there is a number directly to the right
of this tab, it indicates the current number of unhandled Messages.

The unhandled Messages Page is broken down by **Cohort**. For each Cohort, a number
of important pieces of information are displayed.

* The **Recipients (Total)** indicates the total number of Recipients on the Cohort.
* The **Recipients (Active)** indicates the number of active Recipients on the Cohort.
* **Recipients (Inbox)** indicates the total number of Recipients with unhandled
  Messages in that Cohort.
* **Desired Area Code** indicates the desired area code, if any, of the Phone Number
  from which Messages will be sent out to Recipients.
* **Numbers** indicates the Phone Numbers dedicated to sending Messages to Recipients
  on this Cohort.
* To the right of this, there will be a list of Recipients with unhandled Messages. If
  you click on any of these Recipients' Phone Numbers, you will be taken to that Recipient's
  **Message Sender** Page. From there, you can see the text of the Unhandled Message,
  and if you wish send a Message back to that Recipient manually.

For more information about what Messages your deployment is configured to flag for review,
contact [support@instantcensus.com](mailto:support@instantcensus.com).
  
## 7.0.0 Data

To assist you in getting the most out of your Surveys, Instant Census comes packaged
with Data tools to help you see how your **Recipients** are responding, in virtually
real time. 

### 7.1.0 Message Data

The first graph on this page is the **Text Messages Sent and Received** graph. It breaks down
the number of messages used by the system, both sent and received. The Box to the 
right allows you to change the timeframe over which you are viewing system usage. 
By clicking the appropriate buttons, you can change the graph to display messages 
sent over the course of the past hour, day, month, or year. Clicking any of these 
buttons automatically updates the graph to show information for that time period.
Note that this tracks Messages as designated by Instant Census, not actual SMS messages
sent. As a result, a single Instant Census Message might span several SMS messages.

### 7.2.0 Recipient Attributes Data

The second graph on this page is the **Recipient Analytics** graph. It allows you to look
at the various **Recipient Attributes** for a particular **Cohort**. Much like with Message
Data, the box to the right of this graph allows you to change the information
displayed. Changing the Cohort selected from the Cohort dropdown will automatically
update the graph to show information from the selected Cohort. Changing the Recipient
Attribute dropdown will allow you to view the values of different Recipient Attributes
within the selected Cohort. The graph itself is simply a bar graph, which breaks
down the number of Recipients in the Cohort by the value they have in the particular Recipient
Attribute.

### 7.3.0 Response Times Report

The third graph on this page is the **Response Times Report** graph. It gives
you information about how quickly people in a particular Cohort are responding to
the Surveys you send them. The Box to the right of the graph allows you to configure
various features of this graph. The Cohort dropdown allows you to select the Cohort
for which you wish to see data. The four buttons below that allow you to set the
time period for which you will see the selected Cohort's data. By clicking any of
them, the graph will automatically update to show response rates and times for the
selected timeframe.

### 7.4.0 Question/Response Report

The final graph on this page is the **Question/Response Report**. This shows you
how people responded to a particular Question in a Cohort. The Cohort dropdown above
the graph lets you select the **Cohort** for which you wish to see information. The 
**Question** dropdown lets you select the particular Question on that Cohort to
which you wish to see the responses. The graph will automatically update to show
all the responses Instant Census has received for that Question, organized in a bar
graph.

## 8.0.0 Recipients & System Interaction

The tools Instant Census provides can help you construct high quality surveys
to assess and obtain the information you want from your **Recipients**. But for
however carefully you plan and build, there are always pitfalls associated with
the other half of surveying, namely, Recipient responses. This section covers common
problems in interactions with Recipients, as well as explaining some non-configurable
pieces of behavior around Recipient Interaction.

### 8.1.0 Pitfalls

There are a number of common problems found in interacting with Recipients, and these
generally fall into two categories: limitations of SMS as a system, and improper
Recipient responses.

#### 8.1.1 SMS Limitations

Because of the way SMS works, there is the inherent possibility for certain problems
in the sending and receiving of Messages. In particular, there is no guarantee that
a Message will be delivered. While most Messages are delivered, there is always
a chance that Message will simply be dropped, and not reach its intended recipient.
While this is unusual, it will happen, and the more **Recipients** you have and the more
Messages you send, the more likely it is that Messages will be dropped. As a result,
Instant Census can only attempt to send Messages, but cannot guarantee that they
will be received.

In a similar vein, if multiple Messages are sent in a row, there is no way to guarantee
that the Messages will be received by the Recipient in the order they were sent out.
In the event that a series of Messages are sent out in an unexpected order, this
can lead to confusion on the part of the Recipient and lead in to improper Recipient responses,
as described below.

There are a few steps you can take when constructing a Survey that can help ameliorate
the situations above. 

* Try not to send multiple Messages in a row. This means not following a **Message** 
  with a **Question** or another Message unless you absolutely must. Slightly trickier 
  is making sure that a single Message does not end up being longer than 160 characters.
  While Instant Census prohibits you from creating a Message of such length, it is
  possible for a Message to exceed this limit. This is particularly likely to happen
  if you are inserting an especially long **Recipient Attribute** value into a text, or
  automatically appending an especially long set of **Multiple Choice** Answers to
  a Message. While it can be difficult to predict exactly how long Messages processed 
  in these ways will be, it is generally a good idea to make sure the base Message
  is much shorter than 160 characters.
* Make sure your Messages make sense out of context. This is a good idea anyway,
  given resend behaviors, but it is harder for a mis-ordering of texts to confuse
  a Recipient if each Message is intelligible in and of itself.

#### 8.1.2 Improper Recipient Responses

Since you cannot control how **Recipients** will respond to your Surveys, they can create
no end of trouble by acting in a way you do not expect. Generally, these problematic
responses will be categorized as Unhandled Responses, and made available for viewing.
However, it is possible for Improper Recipient Responses to lead to odd behavior. If,
for example, a Recipient is responding to one Question when another is sent, then Instant
Census will interpret their response as being to that of the *second* Question.
It is possible to minimize the chances of these responses, however.

* Space out **Schedules** and **Resends**. Because of the way Schedules and Resends
  interact with ongoing Schedules, it is important to make sure a Message is unlikely
  to send when a Recipient is already responding to a different Question. Put a few hours
  at least between the times Schedules are sent out, and make sure Resends are similarly
  spaced out from other Messages.
* Use **Messages** sparingly. People often feel the need to respond to every text
  message they receive, even if it is just to acknowledge that they have received
  the message. Sending fewer Messages gives Recipients fewer opportunities to do this.
* Word Messages in such a way that it is clear they do not expect a response. Since
  you are sending a Survey, Recipients may be overly likely to construe communications
  as **Questions**. Word those Messages you must send in such a way that it is absolutely
  clear they are *not* looking for a response from the Recipient.
* Word Questions in such a way that possible responses are clear. If you are asking
  a **Yes/No**, **Multiple Choice**, or **Numeric** Question, there are a finite
  number of responses Instant Census will accept from your Recipients. Thus, make sure
  the Question clearly prompts for those responses. For Multiple Choice Questions,
  Instant Census can automatically append a list of choices to the Message; use
  this. Make sure range of Numeric responses is clearly given in the Question, and
  word Yes/No Questions in a way that clearly elicits a Yes/No response.
* Be careful when selecting Multiple Choice responses. Since Recipients must match the
  text of a Multiple Choice exactly to be parsed correctly, you must be very careful
  in wording these choices. While you *can* create multi-word Choices, you should
  probably do so *very* sparingly, and not make the possible responses be more than
  two or three words long. Also, try to make the responses shorter, easily spelled
  words.
  
While it is certain that some Recipients will misinterpret and misuse the system, but
wording your communications in the right way can help minimize that possibility.

### 8.2.0 System Behaviors

While they are not problematic per se, there are some inherent behaviors of Instant
Census with regard to **Recipient** interaction that can be surprising if you do not
expect them.

#### 8.2.1 Recipient Control

There are three Messages a **Recipient** can send in that, instead of being handled in the
normal fashion, instead let them control their experience of Instant Census. These
are built into the system, and cannot be changed or configured by an administrator.

* If a Recipient texts in the Message "Stop", then their **Status** is set to **Disabled**,
  and they cannot be sent any more Messages by Instant Census. No further communication 
  with the Recipient will be possible, unless the Recipient makes it so.
* If a Recipient texts in the Message "Start" while their Status is **Disabled** or **Inactive**
  then their Status will change to **Active** and they will immediately be sent
  a Message indicating that their Status has been successfully changed.
* If a Recipient texts in the Message "Skip" while they have an outstanding **Question**,
  then the Schedule will continue past that Question without requiring an answer
  from the Recipient.

Furthermore, If a Recipient sends in the Message "Stopall", "Unsubscribe", "Cancel", 
"End", or "Quit" they will be sent a Message indicating that if they wish to stop 
receiving Messages from Instant Census, they should send back the Message "Stop".

Similarly, if the Recipient sends in "Help" or "Info", they will be sent a Message indicating
that normal rates and fees apply, and reminding them that they can text "Stop" to
stop receiving Messages from Instant Census.

As a result of their special role in the system, the words "Start", "Stop", and
"Skip" cannot be used as the answer to **Multiple Choice** Questions. Furthermore,
you should not put a Recipient in a situation where one of these words is a possible
answer to a Question, since the system will not accept any of these words as a Recipient
response to a Question.

#### 8.2.2 System Messages

There are a number of situations in which Instant Census will automatically send
Messages to **Recipients**. Most of these have to do with changes in the **Status** of
either the Recipient or the **Cohort** to which they belong. 

* As soon as a Recipient becomes eligible to receive Messages (that is, both the Recipient's 
  and the Cohort's Status are **Active**) for the first time, the Recipient is
  sent the Cohort's **Welcome Message**. This Message includes an element you can
  configure, as well as required content telling them how to opt-out of Instant
  Census and that normal messaging rates apply.
* When a Cohort becomes **Paused**, all Active Recipients on that Cohort are automatically
  sent a Message informing them of this change.
* When a Cohort becomes Active, all Active Recipients on that Cohort are automatically 
  sent a Message letting them know to expect to start receiving more Messages, and
  reiterating how they can opt-out.
* When a Recipient becomes **Inactive**, they are sent a Message telling them they are
  inactive and indicating they should text in "Start" to resume receiving Messages.
* When a Recipient becomes **Paused**, if their Cohort is Active, they are sent a Message
  letting them know they have been paused.
* When a Recipient is set to Active, if their Cohort is also Active, they are sent a
  Message letting them know to expect to receive Messages again. If their Cohort
  is Paused, but they initiated the reactivation through sending in "Start", they
  will be told that they have been reactivated, but the system is not currently
  sending messages, and that they will be notified when it resumes.
  
Additionally, you may set Cohorts to resend Questions if Instant Census receives
an improper response from the Recipient. If you select this, then the Recipient will automatically
receive a Message informing them that Instant Census couldn't understand their answer,
and prompting them to respond again.

If a Recipient sends in the Message "Stopall", "Unsubscribe", "Cancel", "End", or "Quit"
they will be sent a Message indicating that if they wish to stop receiving Messages
from Instant Census, they should send back the Message "Stop".

Similarly, if the Recipient sends in "Help" or "Info", they will be sent a Message indicating
that normal rates and fees apply, and reminding them that they can text "Stop" to
stop receiving Messages from Instant Census.

Finally, Instant Census will automatically send Recipients a Message with the Phone Number
of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline if it thinks the Recipient has sent in a
Message indicating the serious risk of suicide.

#### 8.2.3 Emergency Responses

When Instant Census is employed properly, some **Recipients** may not understand that
they are interacting with an automated system and not a real person. While this
has certain advantages, in that it makes people more likely to respond and more
likely to respond casually and honestly, it can lead to some problems. In particular,
Instant Census is not equipped to help people handle medical emergencies.

While Instant Census attempts to detect Messages that may indicate suicidal intent,
it can only respond by sending the Recipient information on the National Suicide Prevention
Lifeline.

Furthermore, the ways in which someone could ask for other medical aid are too
varied for Instant Census to keep track of. As a result, the system cannot recommend
any kind of medical advice, nor can it contact emergency services for the Recipient.

Messages the Recipient sends in asking for medical help of any kind will be counted as
unhandled Messages and will appear in the **Inbox** Page. For this reason, it
is important that you keep on top of unhandled Recipient responses. It is also important
that you, when onboarding Recipients, make clear to them that Instant Census is an automatic
system and that it *cannot* summon medical aid or emergency services.

#### 8.2.4 Forbidden Words

Because of the methods Instant Census gives to **Recipients** to help them manage their
experience of the system, certain words are reserved for Recipients to send the system
in order to get it to do something. This means that, when a Recipient sends in one of
these words, instead of being handled normally, the system takes it and decides what
to do with it. As a result, these words cannot be designated as Choices in **Multiple
Choice Questions**. You should also take care that any **Open-Ended** or other Questions
do not attempt to solicit these words as responses. If they do, then your Survey
will not work as expected, since these words interact with the system outside the
normal logic of Surveys.

The **Forbidden Words** are: "stop", "stopall", "unsubscribe", "cancel", "end", 
"quit", "skip", "", "ping", "start", "help", and "info".

If a Recipient sends in any one of these words, they will not interact with the logic
of whatever Survey in which they may be participating. Instant Census automatically
deals with the words in a different fashion.

## 9.0.0 Your Account

Much of the salient information about your account can be found at the top of the
**Cohorts** page. This summarizes how many texts you have used, how many texts you
have remaining, and when your texts expire. Other details about your account will
have been given to you by Instant Census, and can be re-sent upon request.

### 9.1.0 System Requirements

In order to utilize Instant Census, you must have a computer, an internet connection,
and a browser. For best results, we recommend you use Google Chrome to access the
Instant Census web application. Because Instant Census relies on a web application
to allow you to use the system, your experience will be dependent upon the speed
of your internet connection. We can make no guarantee as to the speed with which
you will be able to undertake any of the actions described in this documentation.

Furthermore, your **Recipients** must have access to cell phones which are equipped to 
send and receive SMS Messages. It is entirely the responsibility of the Recipient to
have access to this service, and they may be charged for exchanging communications
with Instant Census depending on their wireless plan. Because the Messages are deployed
over SMS, Instant Census cannot guarantee that Messages will be sent in the correct
order, that Messages will be received by the Recipient, and that Messages sent by the 
Recipient will be received. Recipients' experience with Instant Census will be dependent on
their wireless plans, as well as the quality of service in their areas. Wireless
coverage is by no means universal in the United States, and some Recipients may find
themselves in areas not covered by wireless service. Such Recipients will be unable to
interact with Instant Census properly.

At this time, Instant Census only supports sending and receiving Messages within
the United States. The Instant Census service is not designed, nor has it approved,
for usage in countries other than the USA. Any attempts to send Messages to non-US
Phone Numbers is highly discouraged, and Instant Census will actively take measures to
prevent such usage of Instant Census.

### 9.2.0 Security

In order to access the Instant Census web application, you will need to have your own
log in credentials that will allow you to access all of the features
of the web application. You are solely responsible for guarding the security of
these, and in the event that you allow them to fall into malicious hands, Instant Census
can make no guarantees as to the security of your data or the usage of your deployment
of Instant Census. By necessity anyone who has access to your login credentials
has access to any and all of your data, even confidential data about your **Recipients**.
It is thus advisable that you log out of Instant Census when you are done using it.
Failure to do so could leave Instant Census accessible to anyone who happens to
encounter your computer. To logout, click the Button at the far right of the
**Navigation Bar**. Instant Census will automatically log you out after 24 hours.

To reset your password, click the **Forgot Password?** link at the bottom of the
login page. This will take you to a new page prompting you to enter your email address.
This must be the same as the email address you have associated with your account. 
Upon submitting your email, Instant Census will check to see if there is an Administrator
with that email address. If there is, that email address will be sent an email allowing
you to reset your password. As a consequence of this, anyone who gains unauthorized
access to your email account can theoretically gain access to your Instant Census
Account. Zagaran is not responsible for the security of your email address, and you
bear all responsibility for unauthorized use of your Instant Census deployment as
a result of a breach in your email security.

All data received by Instant Census from **Recipients** are stored in firewall-protected 
servers. These servers can be accessed only through an SSH using 2048 bit RSA, and 
access to these servers beyond your login credentials is restricted to authorized 
employees of Instant Census only. Furthermore, all data received by Instant Census 
are stored on servers dedicated to that deployment and that deployment only, to 
minimize the risk of accidental interchange. The employees given access are carefully 
vetted, and access is restricted to the absolute minimum required for the successful 
functioning of the project. Even so, any data kept by Instant Census for internal 
company use after the term of the contract is fully anonymized.

Instant Census only shares data with outside parties when this is specifically
required by law, and strict procedures are followed in allowing these parties access.

It is, however, worth noting that while Instant Census does its best to maintain security 
during data storage and processing, there are certain inherent vulnerabilities, 
particularly on the Recipients' and researchers' ends. SMS is not a secure communication 
medium, and anyone who has access to a Recipient's phone has the possibility to see that 
Recipient's responses. Instant Census cannot speak for the care with which a Recipient will 
treat their data, and there is no guarantee that the Recipient will password protect 
their phone or regularly delete their SMS history.

It may also be possible for third parties to access data once it has been received 
by you. Much like in the case of the participant, Instant Census cannot control 
your security practices. Thus, Instant Census cannot make any guarantees about the 
security of data once you have accessed it and stored it on any of your own devices
and systems. Having said that, we are certainly willing to discuss proper security
practices with you beforehand to help you make the best choices about how to protect 
your data.

Furthermore, Zagaran is not responsible for any malicious code that may enter the
system through either you or your Recipients. While Zagaran attempts to properly sanitize
any incoming messages or items added to the system to prevent the entry of malicious
code, this process is not and cannot be foolproof. Zagaran cannot control how you
or your Recipients utilize the system, or the content added to the system by the same.

Instant Census's data protection and security policies are rigorously enforced by 
the company at all times and in all places.

### 9.3.0 Billing

For a comprehensive view of the cost structure of your deployment of Instant Census,
consult the agreement you made with Instant Census. This is the only source for the costs
you will incur when using Instant Census, and any other agreements, either verbally
or in writing are superseded by that agreement.

Bear in mind that for the purposes of costs and billing, Messages includes not just
Messages sent out *from* Instant Census but also messages sent in *to* Instant Census.
While you can control the former, the latter is entirely in the hands of your **Recipients**
who may send in as many Messages as they see fit. Instant Census does not and cannot
prevent Recipients from sending Messages in to Instant Census, and bears no responsibility
for the number of Messages sent in by your Recipients. Thus, it is important to keep
track of Message Usage on the **Cohorts** Page.

In the event that you equal or exceed your Message allotment for a given billing
period, your usage of Instant Census will be curtailed. Instant Census will make a good
faith effort to inform you in advance when this is about to happen, and give you
every opportunity to increase your Message capacity. However, given that Instant Census
cannot control the speed and frequency with which Messages are used, it may be
impossible to give you warning. In any event, your ability to send new Messages
will be suspended, and new Messages sent in by your Recipients will be ignored. As soon
as your Message capacity increases, your usage of Instant Census will be able to
resume as normal.

Note that there may be a slight discrepency between your message usage as displayed
by the various data reports and the number of messages for which you are billed.
This is due to Instant Census not tracking messages in 160-character chunks, while
you are billed on the basis of actual SMS messages sent and received. If you
send messages longer than 160 characters, your billable messages will be higher than
your messages as displayed by Instant Census data reports.

You may, at any time, increase your Message capacity. Simply contact your Instant
Census sales representative, or email [sales@instantcensus.com](mailto:sales@instantcensus.com).
